# Assessment-Manager
Developed to facilitate Assessment Submission, Evaluation and Grading. Nodejs has been used for Backend and React Js for Frontend.

Here we get 3 roles with different permission levels
* Student: Can submit an assessment to a particular mentor.
* Mentor: Can add and grade an assessment(Can be a mentor with registration as mentor, will also have the facilities of a student)
* Admin: Can add/edit/delete, assessment, users, submissions and grades(Only Database admin can make someone an admin)

We have to run the client project and server project concurrently.

Enjoy!!
